MEDICINE BALL POWER COACH - QUICK START GUIDE
==============================================

STEP 1: TRAIN THE MODEL (For Maximum Accuracy)
-----------------------------------------------
Run this command to train on your Roboflow dataset:

    python train_for_accuracy.py

This will:
- Use your 207 images (145 train / 41 val / 21 test)
- Train for 300 epochs with early stopping
- Apply heavy data augmentation
- Save best model automatically

Training time:
- CPU: 8-12 hours
- GPU: 2-4 hours

You can stop anytime with Ctrl+C - progress is saved!


STEP 2: ANALYZE YOUR VIDEO
---------------------------
After training (or use pretrained models), analyze any video:

    python analyze_video.py your_video.mp4

Supported formats: MP4, MOV, AVI
Max size: Any size (no limit)


WHAT YOU GET:
-------------
📊 SCORES (0-10 or 0-100):
  - Power Score
  - Technique Quality
  - Explosiveness
  - Symmetry
  - Safety/Control
  - Release Velocity

📐 KEY ANGLES:
  - Max Knee Flexion
  - Max Hip Flexion
  - Trunk Angle

✅ STRENGTHS:
  - What you're doing well

💡 IMPROVEMENTS:
  - Specific areas to work on

🏋️ EXERCISES:
  - Recommended drills


EXAMPLE USAGE:
--------------
# Train model first (one time)
python train_for_accuracy.py

# Then analyze videos
python analyze_video.py throw1.mp4
python analyze_video.py throw2.mp4
python analyze_video.py throw3.mp4


TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS:
----------------------
1. Record from side or 45° angle
2. Show full body in frame
3. Keep ball visible throughout
4. Good lighting
5. Stable camera (tripod recommended)
6. 5-10 second videos work best


DATASET INFO:
-------------
Your current dataset:
- 207 total images
- 2 classes: Athlete, Medicine Ball
- Source: Roboflow
- Format: YOLOv8

To improve accuracy:
- Add more training videos
- Record in different conditions
- Upload to Roboflow
- Retrain model


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Q: Video won't open?
A: Check file format (MP4, MOV, AVI) and path

Q: Low scores?
A: Train custom model with your data first

Q: Slow processing?
A: Normal on CPU, use GPU for faster analysis

Q: Want better accuracy?
A: Add more training data and retrain
