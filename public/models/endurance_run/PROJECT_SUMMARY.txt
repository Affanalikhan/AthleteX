================================================================================
TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE
================================================================================

System Flow:
1. User uploads video via React frontend
2. Frontend sends video to FastAPI backend (HTTP POST)
3. Backend saves video temporarily
4. OpenCV processes video frame by frame
5. MediaPipe extracts pose landmarks from each frame
6. Gait analyzer calculates metrics from landmarks
7. Coaching engine generates recommendations
8. Results returned to frontend as JSON
9. Dashboard displays metrics and feedback

API Endpoints:
- POST /analyze: Upload and analyze video
- GET /: Health check
- GET /docs: API documentation (Swagger UI)

Data Flow:
Video → Frames → Pose Landmarks → Features → Metrics → Recommendations

================================================================================
METRICS CALCULATED
================================================================================

1. CADENCE
   - Definition: Steps per minute
   - Calculation: Count foot strikes over time
   - Optimal Range: 170-180 spm
   - Importance: Higher cadence reduces injury risk

2. GROUND CONTACT TIME
   - Definition: Time foot is on ground per step
   - Calculation: Duration between foot strike and toe-off
   - Optimal Range: 200-250ms
   - Importance: Shorter time indicates better efficiency

3. STRIDE SYMMETRY
   - Definition: Balance between left and right strides
   - Calculation: Comparison of stride lengths
   - Optimal Range: 95-100%
   - Importance: Asymmetry may indicate injury or imbalance

4. EFFICIENCY SCORE
   - Definition: Overall running form quality
   - Calculation: Weighted combination of all metrics
   - Scale: 0-100
   - Interpretation:
     * 80-100: Excellent form
     * 60-79: Good form
     * 40-59: Fair form, room for improvement
     * 0-39: Poor form, significant issues
